commons-lang-taglibs
====================
Require commons-lang-2.4.jar in classpath

Collection of taglibs files for Apache Commons-Lang

I wrote it many years ago I couldn't remember. I just found
it in some of my projects and I think that it might be useful for somebody.
Maybe it can help someone save the day.

If you want to update this one, you can fork it or make a pull request.
I prefer latter because it's better to have single updated repository.
You may ask me to join this project if you want.

Feel free to ask me any questions and vist my website
